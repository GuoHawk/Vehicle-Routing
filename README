This project focuses on the set covering based formulation for the capacitated vehicle routing 
problem (CVRP). A column generation approach based on dynamic programming has been used to find 
the lower bound for the optimal solution.

The following libraries need to be installed for the code to run
 NumPy
 Matplotlib
 Networkx
 Gurobi(Commmercial MIP solver)
